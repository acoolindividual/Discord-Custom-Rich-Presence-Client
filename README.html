<h1 id="discord-custom-rich-presence-client">Discord Custom Rich Presence Client</h1>
<p>This is a simple client for Discord&#39;s Rich Presence API. It allows you to set a custom activity for your Discord profile, allowing the use of images and multiple fields</p>
<p><img src="/example.png" alt="Example" title="Example"></p>
<h2 id="quick-setup">Quick Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest release from the <a href="https://github.com/acoolindividual/Discord-Custom-Rich-Presence-Client/releases/">releases page</a></li>
<li>Make yourself an application on the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">Discord Developer Portal</a></li>
<li>Under the Rich Presence tab, upload the images you&#39;d like to use and take note of their names</li>
<li>Take note of your application&#39;s Client ID, present in the General Information tab</li>
<li>Unzip the release file and open config.json in a text editor</li>
<li>Get your Discord token by following <a href="https://discordhelp.net/discord-token">this guide</a></li>
<li>Fill out the config.json file using the config guide (below)</li>
<li>Start the client by running the .exe file</li>
<li>End the client by closing the command prompt window or pressing Ctrl+C</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="config-guide">Config Guide</h2>
<p>The config.json file is very stringent on formatting and will not work if important characters (such as commas, brackets, and quotes) are missing or misplaced. It is recommended to use a JSON validator to ensure that your config file is valid before starting the client.</p>
<p>You must remove optional fields which you do not use. For example, if you do not want to use the &quot;state&quot; field, you must remove the entire &quot;state&quot; key/value pair from the config file. Ensure that the commas in the field are correct, and that the last field in the config file does not have a comma after it.</p>
<p>I intend to add an easier way to configure the client in the future, but for now this is the only way.</p>
